/**
 * Draws a form wherever the simulation has put it, for <em>any</em> form that has been given the
 * rigid body modifier.
 *
 * <p>This is what replaced the wrapper form (Р7). A physics body used to be a form of its own with
 * a renderer of its own, and the substitution lived there; now the modifier can be on a block, an
 * item, a model or a group, so the substitution has to happen where every form's transform is
 * applied — the base renderer. Two overloads of {@code applyTransforms} cover both paths BBS
 * draws through, and only {@code ModelFormRenderer} overrides either one, calling {@code super}
 * both times, so nothing slips past.</p>
 *
 * <p>While the animation still owns the body, or on a frame the recording has not reached (Р8.1),
 * this falls straight through and the form is drawn from its keyframes as usual. <b>Scale is never
 * substituted</b>: physics has an opinion about where a thing is and which way up, not about how
 * big it is drawn — and it is read through {@code createTransform} rather than off the form, so
 * that states and overlays still count.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>By the handle's weight, not as a switch.</b> Between the two ends the drawn frame is the
 * animated one blended with the simulated one, the way a ragdoll's bones have always been drawn
 * ({@code PhysicsBodyState.getWeight}). It used to be all or nothing here, and the fade was left to
 * the pull in the solver — which holds a body tight almost to the bottom of the handle, so a
 * release drawn over ten frames looked held for nine of them and thrown on the tenth, and the pull
 * spent those nine frames rubbing off the speed the throw was made of.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Never during the simulation's own pose walk.</b> That walk exists to ask where the
 * <em>animation</em> has this form, because that is the target the body is pulled towards; a walk
 * that answered with the body's own last position would be handing the pull the body's own answer,
 * and the pull would have nothing to close but the gap between a thing and itself. What it did
 * instead was rub the body's speed away by the handle every tick and hold it nowhere at all: a
 * half-released crate stopped dead in the air rather than trailing its keyframes. The ragdoll pose
 * applier is flagged off for the same walk and for the same reason — this is that flag, read from
 * the other side of the substitution.</p>
