/**
 * Swaps the banner of the selection screen — the picture above the list of films, worlds and the
 * rest — for the addon's own.
 *
 * <p>BBS made the banner overridable, but only for a subclass of its own; the screens are built
 * by BBS itself, so there is no subclass of ours to put there. The override is taken from here
 * instead. The texture lives under {@code textures/banners/} the way BBS's does — the texture
 * picker skips that folder, which keeps the banner out of the list of pickable textures.</p>
