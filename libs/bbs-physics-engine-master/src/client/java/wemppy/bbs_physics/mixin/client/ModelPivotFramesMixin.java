/**
 * Lets the chain physics see a fallen skeleton.
 *
 * <p>The chains read their anchor frames through a pivot-frame walk that skips every bone's
 * {@code offset} by default — the right rule for the IK stretch it was written for, and the wrong
 * one for a ragdoll, whose whole fall is carried in those offsets: a character lying on the floor
 * would have its hair anchored at standing height. While the form being rendered has a ragdoll in
 * charge (the flag the pose applier raises), the walk is asked to fold offsets in — which the
 * walk's own contract endorses for ancestor offsets, and ancestors are the only place a ragdoll
 * writes them.</p>
