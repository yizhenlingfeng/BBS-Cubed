/**
 * Puts the Physics tab into every form editor.
 *
 * <p>{@code registerDefaultPanels} is the one call every form editor makes, and it makes it last —
 * after its own type-specific tabs and just before the general one. Hooking its head therefore
 * lands the tab in the same place for a model, a block, an item and a group alike, without this
 * mixin having to know that any of those exist.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Two tabs, not three and not one.</b> Collision, ragdoll and physics were three tabs until
 * Р7 folded them into one; the ragdoll half then turned out to need its own answer — which bones
 * fall, as opposed to which have a shape — and with that answer in place the tab split back into
 * two. Shape is described once per model in Collision and forgotten; Physics is what an author
 * returns to. The three-tab arrangement is not coming back: it had half the ragdoll tab greyed out
 * telling the author to go and use the collision tab first.</p>
 *
 * <p>The tab belongs here rather than in BBS: every form has a shape, but a shape only means
 * anything while there is an engine to collide it with. Adding it to BBS proper was considered and
 * turned down — BBS without the addon has to stay BBS without the addon.</p>
