/**
 * Adds the addon's section to the form palette.
 *
 * <p>This is the one place BBS offers no way in: its sections are a hardcoded list built in
 * {@code setup()}, with the field private and no method to add to it. Since the palette is the
 * only way a user can reach a new form, the list is appended to from here — after {@code setup()}
 * has finished with its own, so nothing is disturbed on the way.</p>
 *
 * <p>(This mixin existed once before, for the retired physics-body wrapper, and left with it in
 * Э4. Cloth being a form again — Р12 — brings it back word for word.)</p>
