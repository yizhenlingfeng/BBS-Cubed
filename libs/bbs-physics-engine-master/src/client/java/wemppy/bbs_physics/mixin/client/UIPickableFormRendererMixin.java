/**
 * Draws the collision markup over the model in the <em>form editor's</em> viewport.
 *
 * <p>A separate mixin from {@link UIFormRendererMixin} for one reason: the form editor does not use
 * the plain form renderer. It uses this one — the pickable flavour, with the gizmo and the stencil
 * pass — and it overrides {@code renderUserModel} outright rather than extending it, so an
 * injection into the parent never runs here. Since it never calls its parent either, the two
 * mixins can never both fire for the same viewport.</p>
 *
 * <p>Injected at the tail, which is after the stencil pass — and that pass leaves the GL viewport
 * pointing at the whole window rather than at the preview. {@link EditorPreview} puts it back; the
 * reason it has to is written out there.</p>
