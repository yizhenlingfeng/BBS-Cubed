/**
 * Where the addon attaches itself to a running film.
 *
 * <p>BBS posts events to addons while it starts up, but nothing during a film — so the four
 * moments a simulation needs are taken from {@link BaseFilmController} directly. Every way of
 * running a film goes through this class: playback in the world, the film editor's live scene, and
 * the frozen frame the editor leaves standing. That matters more than it looks — a simulation that
 * only ran during playback would make the editor's viewport disagree with the exported video.</p>
 *
 * <p>Attaching by mixin rather than by asking BBS for events keeps this addon self-contained: BBS
 * is not modified at all, which means no merge conflicts across its three branches and no
 * republishing it after every change here. The cost is that these four method names are now a
 * contract — rename one and the addon fails to load, loudly, at startup.</p>
