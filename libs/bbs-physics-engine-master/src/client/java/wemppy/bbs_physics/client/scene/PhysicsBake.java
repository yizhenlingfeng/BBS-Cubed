/**
 * Turns the recording of one form's physics into ordinary keyframes of its replay — Blender's
 * "Bake to Keyframes", the last open item of Э3 (§9.3 of the concept).
 *
 * <p><b>What is written.</b> A rigid body becomes keys on the form's own {@code transform}, on the
 * ticks the simulation moved it (see {@link Track}), holding exactly the position and rotation the renderer was substituting. A ragdoll or a
 * strand of hair becomes keys on the per-bone pose tracks — the same tracks the author gets when
 * keyframing a bone by hand — holding the local rotation and shift that land each bone where the
 * simulation had it. After that the film plays the same with the simulation switched off, and every
 * one of those keys can be dragged, deleted or retimed like any other.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What is baked is what was drawn</b>, not what the world computed. The renderer weighs the
 * simulated pose against the animated one by the authority handle (§4), so on a tick the animation
 * owns outright the baked key is the animation's own value, untouched, and on a half-released
 * tick it is the blend the viewport was showing. Baking anything else would change the film in the
 * act of freezing it.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Two passes, on purpose.</b> A bone track is <em>additive</em> — its value is composed on
 * top of the form's pose and of whatever the track already held — so a key written on tick 10
 * would change what tick 11 evaluates to before tick 11 had been read. Every tick is therefore
 * worked out against the film as it stands, and only then is anything written, inside one edit
 * of the film so that the whole bake is one step of the undo history.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Rotations are stored as quaternions</b> where the simulation had a say. The concept
 * warned that Euler conventions are where this kind of thing goes wrong (§10.1), and the
 * {@code Transform} of BBS can hold a rotation either way; a quaternion key composes with the
 * animation exactly as the ragdoll applier composed it, with no angle to unwrap. On ticks the
 * animation owned the key stays in Euler form, so a bone nobody released is left byte for byte as
 * the author had it.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Afterwards the handle is set to 1</b> and its own track is emptied: the animation owns the
 * form again, which is the whole point. The modifier itself stays — its settings are kept, and a
 * body the animation owns still collides with everything around it, so a baked crate goes on
 * pushing the crates that were not baked. Blender removes the rigid body instead; keeping it is
 * the more useful of the two here and costs nothing.</p>
