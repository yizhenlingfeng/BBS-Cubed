/**
 * Decides whether an edit the author just made can change the film's physics — and so whether the
 * recording has to be thrown away and worked out again.
 *
 * <p>Until now every edit under a film's replays did: a renamed replay, a recoloured model, a
 * shadow toggled, a keyframe moved on an actor with no physics in the scene at all — each of them
 * restarted the simulation from the opening frame, and the bar under the timeline went grey for
 * nothing. Blender has the same rule of "any edit invalidates" only for the things the simulation
 * actually reads; this is that list for us.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The list is of what is harmless, not of what matters.</b> Naming what physics reads would
 * mean keeping that list in step with every rig ever added, and a miss there is the worst kind of
 * bug — a recording that is quietly wrong. Naming what it provably ignores (a label, a colour, a
 * hitbox) means a miss costs one needless re-simulation, which is what happened before anyway.
 * Anything not on the list invalidates.</p>
 *
 * <p>Two things that look cosmetic are deliberately <em>not</em> here. A texture decides the
 * "by pixels" collision plates, so it is geometry to the simulation. And whether a form is visible
 * is read by the markup collector, so it stays an edit that counts.</p>
