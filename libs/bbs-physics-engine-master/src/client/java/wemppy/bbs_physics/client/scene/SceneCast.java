/**
 * The film's actors, as the simulation needs them: able to be stood on any tick, and put back
 * afterwards exactly as they were found.
 *
 * <p><b>Physics has to read the film at whole ticks of its own choosing</b>, and the only way to
 * read an actor at a tick is to write that tick's keyframes into the entity — the same entity BBS is
 * about to draw. So the cast is <em>borrowed</em> and handed back, always in a {@code finally}: an
 * exception halfway through a catch-up would otherwise leave everyone standing wherever the last
 * simulated step put them, which is a film visibly broken by a failure that was recovered from.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Everyone is placed before any pose is evaluated</b>, never actor by actor as each is walked.
 * An anchored actor is placed through the actor it rides, so a walk that ran while half the cast was
 * still on the previous tick would resolve that anchor against a stale position. The unsimulated
 * actors are here for exactly that reason — an actor with no physics of its own can still be the
 * one another actor is riding.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The order is by replay index, ascending.</b> BBS keys its actors in a hash map, whose
 * iteration order is an implementation detail; here it decides which actor the scene is centred on
 * and in which order bodies enter the world, and Jolt resolves a pile in body order. Two runs of the
 * same film that disagreed about it would settle a stack of crates differently.</p>
