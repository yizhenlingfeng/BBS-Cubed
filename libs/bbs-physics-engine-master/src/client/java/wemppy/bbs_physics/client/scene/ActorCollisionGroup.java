/**
 * Who, inside one actor, is excused from colliding with whom.
 *
 * <p>Jolt's layer table answers this between <em>kinds</em> of body — props against bones, bones
 * against the world — and that is the wrong grain for a character, because the pairs that must not
 * collide here are all in the same two layers. So every body an actor's skeleton is made of, its
 * kinematic bones and its ragdolls' parts alike, is given the same collision group id and this one
 * table; two bodies of the same group ask it, and bodies of different groups (a different actor, a
 * prop) never do and collide normally.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What it excuses, and why each pair would otherwise be a disaster rather than a waste.</b></p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>A ragdoll part against a kinematic bone of its own actor.</b> The layer table has props
 * meet bones on purpose — that is a crate landing on a shoulder — and a released ragdoll part is in
 * the props layer, so without this it meets the bones of the very character it belongs to. Those
 * shapes are neighbours by construction: they were cut from one skeleton and they overlap wherever
 * two bones join. A kinematic body cannot be pushed, so the whole of resolving that overlap is
 * dumped on the part, and it is thrown out of its own character. This is exactly the case Р9 exists
 * for — collision on the body and the head, ragdoll on the head alone.</li>
 * <li><b>A ragdoll part against the part it is jointed to.</b> Neighbours share a joint, meet at it
 * by design and always will; letting them collide has every joint permanently fighting its own
 * limits.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Everything else about an actor still collides, which is the point of not simply switching the
 * pair off in the layer table: parts of one ragdoll that are <em>not</em> jointed keep each other
 * out (an arm does not fold through the chest), and another actor's animated hand can still shove a
 * fallen character, because that hand is in a different group.</p>
 *
 * <p>Native, and held by Jolt by pointer for as long as the bodies exist — so whoever builds one
 * keeps it in a field until the world goes.</p>
