/**
 * Draws a ragdoll's joints over the model, in the form editor.
 *
 * <p>This is the answer to the most unpredictable thing in the addon. Which bone hangs off which is
 * decided in three steps (§5.3) — the author's own attachment, the nearest marked ancestor, and
 * failing both, geometry — and until now <b>the author had no way of learning which one fired</b>.
 * A standard player rig resolves entirely by geometry, so "why is the arm jointed to the torso and
 * not to the shoulder" was a question the interface simply refused to answer.</p>
 *
 * <p>What is drawn: a line from each bone's pivot to the pivot of whatever it hangs on, a dot at
 * the joint itself, and the colour of the joint's kind — so a knee that is still a cone rather than
 * a hinge is visible as a colour, before the character falls over sideways in the film.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Welds are drawn too</b>, in a colour of their own ({@link RagdollWelds}): a bone ticked out
 * of the ragdoll under a falling one is not jointed to it, it <em>is</em> it, and the two readings
 * of an unticked bone — welded into its parent, or standing still on the animation — are otherwise
 * indistinguishable until the character falls.</p>
 *
 * <p>Depth testing is off for the same reason the collision preview turns it off: joints live
 * inside the model, and an overlay that respected depth would be an overlay nobody ever sees.</p>
