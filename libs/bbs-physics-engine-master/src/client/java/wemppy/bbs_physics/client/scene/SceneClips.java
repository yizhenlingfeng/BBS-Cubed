/**
 * The physics action clips of a film — the Э5 pushes and tears — fired into the simulation.
 *
 * <p>They go off <em>inside the recording</em>, once per simulated tick, and that is what keeps them
 * deterministic: a re-recording replays the same clip on the same tick and the film comes out the
 * same. They are also applied <em>after</em> the tick's drives, deliberately — a drive writes a
 * body's velocity outright, so a push applied before it would be erased in the same tick it was
 * given. Landing on top, the push survives, and the next tick's drive mixes it away by the handle's
 * proportion, which is the muscles resisting the blast and exactly what partial authority means.</p>
