/**

 * compared against what the model looks like. This is how a physics bug is diagnosed — a collider
 * in the wrong place is obvious the moment it is drawn and invisible otherwise.
 *
 * <p>The film's impulse clips are marked too: a cross at the point, the ring of the radius, an
 * arrow for a directed push. The point is a number typed into a panel — world coordinates, which
 * the first live run proved nobody can aim by eye — and the overlay is the one place that can show
 * where the blast actually is before the author wonders why nothing moved. Dim while the film is
 * elsewhere, bright on the frames the clip covers.</p>
 *
 * <p>Drawn with the world's depth buffer intact, so a body behind a wall is behind the wall: the
 * overlay is meant to show where things are, and one that floated over the scene would be lying
 * about depth.</p>
