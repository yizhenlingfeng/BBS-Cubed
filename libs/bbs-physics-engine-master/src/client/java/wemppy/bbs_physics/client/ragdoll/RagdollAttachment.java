/**
 * Who hangs off whom in a ragdoll — the three-step answer, in one place.
 *
 * <p>It lived inside the ragdoll builder until the preview needed it too, and a preview that worked
 * out attachment its own way would be a preview that lies. Both callers now read the same answer:
 * the simulation builds joints from it, the viewport draws lines along it.</p>
 *
 * <p>In order of authority:</p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>the author's explicit "attaches to" on the bone;</li>
 * <li>the nearest marked ancestor up the bone tree;</li>
 * <li><b>geometry</b> — whatever is left loose grows onto the skeleton nearest-first, measured from
 * a bone's pivot to another part's shapes.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The third step exists because of Minecraft's own player rig: its arms, head, legs and torso
 * are all children of empty container bones, so no ancestor walk joins any of them to anything, and
 * without it a standard player ragdoll is six parts falling separately. Growing nearest-first
 * cannot make a cycle — a part only ever attaches to something already connected — and when the
 * whole rig is loose the bulkiest part is declared the trunk, which for a humanoid is the torso.
 * </p>
