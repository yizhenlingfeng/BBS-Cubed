/**
 * A body's transform on the render side, in the two ticks the current frame sits between.
 *
 * <p>Physics steps at the film's 20 Hz while the game draws at whatever the monitor does, so a
 * body drawn straight from Jolt would visibly stutter. Keeping the previous tick's transform next
 * to the current one lets the frame be drawn between them — the same trick Minecraft plays on its
 * own entities with {@code tickDelta}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Both transforms come out of {@link PhysicsCache} rather than out of Jolt: the world is a
 * recorder now, not a source of pictures, and it may be hundreds of ticks ahead of the cursor. The
 * body writes itself into the recording as each tick is simulated and reads itself back out as each
 * frame is drawn.</p>
 *
 * <p>The debug overlay draws each of the body's {@link Shape}s in the body's frame — a compound
 * collider is several of them, a plain body is one. What is drawn is exactly what the simulation
 * collides with, down to the shape being round when it is round, because an overlay that prettied
 * things up would be useless for the one thing it exists for: seeing where the engine thinks the
 * shapes are.</p>
