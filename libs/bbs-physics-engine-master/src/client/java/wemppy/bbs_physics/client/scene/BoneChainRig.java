/**
 * One model's hanging strands: the bones an author ticked into the chain modifier, each as a rigid
 * capsule on a springy cone joint, hanging off whatever the bone tree says they hang off.
 *
 * <p><b>The same machinery as the chain form, aimed at bones instead of at segments of its own</b>
 * (Э8's second half). A strand is worked out from the bone tree rather than stored: a claimed bone
 * whose parent is not claimed starts one, and it runs down through claimed children, so two braids
 * off one root are simply two strands sharing an anchor. What holds the top is, in order of
 * preference: the kinematic body of the parent bone when the author marked that bone up for
 * collision, and otherwise a kinematic pin of our own driven along the parent bone's frame. The
 * second case is the common one — nobody marks up a scalp — and it is what makes "add the modifier,
 * tick the hair, it swings" true without any collision setup at all.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The pose comes back exactly the way the ragdoll's does</b>: recorded in the model's flipped
 * group space and substituted into {@code ModelGroup.orient}/{@code offset} between IK and the old
 * chain solver, through the very same applier. Which is also why the old solver has to be silenced
 * on these bones — see {@code ChainMute}: two owners for one strand is one strand doing neither
 * thing convincingly.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What the strands collide with is the actor's own markup</b> (Вемпи's call): the segments sit
 * in the props layer, so they land on the marked bones of the character they belong to — mark the
 * body up and the hair rests on the shoulders. The one pair that must not exist is a strand's first
 * segment against the bone it hangs from: those shapes overlap by construction at the anchor, and
 * a kinematic bone cannot give way, so the depenetration would fire the hair off the head.</p>
