/**
 * The bone list both physics screens are built on: BBS's bone tree, multi-select, with one
 * correction of its own.
 *
 * <p>Multi-select is the whole point of it — a rig is described in groups, and the gestures are the
 * ones BBS's pose bone list already taught (Shift for a run, Ctrl for one more), so nothing new has
 * to be learned to mark up ten fingers at once.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The correction: a Shift run means the rows on screen.</b> {@link mchorse.bbs_mod.ui.framework.elements.input.list.UIList}
 * walks its backing list between the two ends of the run, which is exact until the search box
 * narrows what is drawn — then the run quietly swallows every bone that happens to lie between the
 * two clicks in the full skeleton, on screen or not. In a list that only selects, that is a
 * cosmetic surprise; here the selection is what edits are <em>written</em> into, so it would be a
 * mode switch silently rewriting bones the author never saw. The run is therefore walked over the
 * visible rows instead.</p>
