/**
 * One actor's collision as kinematic bodies: physics never moves them, they move physics. This is
 * what makes an animated character part of the simulated world — a falling crate lands on a
 * shoulder, and later a ragdoll's limbs have something to be driven towards.
 *
 * <p>Kinematic rather than static because a static body has no velocity: things resting on it
 * would be left behind when it moves, instead of being carried and shoved. {@code moveKinematic}
 * gives Jolt a target for the next tick and lets it work out the velocity that gets there, which
 * is what makes the contact push.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Only what is marked up.</b> Every piece here comes from the form tree's collision markup
 * (§5.2) — nothing is measured behind the author's back. A model whose bones nobody marked has no
 * bodies at all, which is the intended default: marking every cube costs contacts on geometry that
 * was never meant to collide, and it would take ownership of the bones hair and cloth are about to
 * be driven by. One body per marked slot, so a hand can shove a crate without the knee joining in.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Known limit, deliberate for now:</b> the pose is only known at the tick the film is on. A
 * seek that re-simulates twenty ticks stands the bodies still at the pose of the tick it is heading
 * for, because computing the pose of every tick in between would mean replaying the whole property
 * track per step. So a tick arrived at by scrubbing is not bit-for-bit the tick arrived at by
 * playing, for any actor that moves — the props are exact either way, the character's shoving of
 * them is not. Making it exact means sampling the pose per tick, which belongs with the ragdoll
 * work in Э2. What it must never do is <em>steer</em> across a jump: a kinematic body keeps the
 * velocity it was given, so a target one tick away, integrated over twenty, throws the body
 * twentyfold across the scene, raking everything on the way. Hence {@code place}.</p>
