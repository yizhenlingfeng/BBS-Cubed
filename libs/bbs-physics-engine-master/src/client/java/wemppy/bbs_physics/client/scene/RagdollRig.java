/**
 * One model's ragdoll: its marked-up bones as rigid bodies held together by joints, and the single
 * "animation strength" handle deciding who owns the pose — the keyframes or the fall.
 *
 * <p><b>Which bones become bodies is the collision markup's decision</b>, not a second markup of
 * its own (§5.2): a bone marked in the collision tab is a ragdoll part, an unmarked one does not
 * exist to physics. The ragdoll tab only says how the parts are jointed — a soft cone by default,
 * so an enabled ragdoll works with nothing configured, just drunkenly: knees bend every way until
 * they are told they are hinges.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>A bone that does not fall is not always a bone that stands still.</b> One left out of the
 * ragdoll underneath a falling bone — headwear on a head, a badge on a chest — is welded into that
 * bone's body rather than given one of its own: its shapes join the owner's compound and travel with
 * it, and the renderer carries the bone itself along for free, since a weld is only ever resolved
 * along the bone tree. See {@link RagdollWelds} for why the tree and nothing else decides that, and
 * why this is not a fixed joint. A bone with no falling bone above it is unaffected and stays the
 * kinematic body it always was — that is the torso walking on while the head comes off.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The skeleton is held by Jolt's own joints</b> — {@code SwingTwistConstraint} for the cone,
 * {@code HingeConstraint} for knees and elbows, {@code FixedConstraint} for welds — created once at
 * scene build and living as long as the world, so the recording's shape never changes. Adjacent
 * parts are excused from colliding with each other through a group filter; everything else
 * collides normally, which is what keeps an arm from folding through the chest.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The handle drives exactly like a physics body's.</b> At 1 the parts are kinematic bones —
 * the same thing {@link BoneRig} builds, shoving props and ignoring gravity. Below 1 they turn
 * dynamic and are pulled towards the animated pose by the same velocity blend
 * {@link BodyRig} was proven with: each tick every part is offered the velocity that would
 * carry it to its keyframed place, mixed with what it already has in the handle's proportion. The
 * joints stay out of that bargain and only enforce their limits, so at 0.6 the character walks
 * where it is told while sagging and stumbling into what it hits, and at 0 it is entirely the
 * world's problem.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The handle is the drawn pose's weight as well as the drive's</b>, and both ends of it are
 * exact: at 1 nothing is substituted and the animation draws itself, at 0 the bodies are the pose
 * outright, and in between the two are mixed by that much (see {@code RagdollPoseApplier}). It has
 * to be a weight rather than a threshold in both places or the fade has a cliff at whichever end
 * the threshold sits — which it did, at the top, where a ragdoll being taken back by the animation
 * jerked the last of the way home. Blending rather than overruling also settles what happens to IK
 * on a ragdolled bone for free: it is faded out with everything else instead of being muted, and
 * the pose the parts are pulled towards includes it either way.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Cubic models only, for now.</b> The simulated pose is handed back through the model's
 * group frames ({@code orient}/{@code offset}), which BOBJ models do not have — a BOBJ model would
 * fall invisibly, so it does not get a ragdoll at all and its bones stay kinematic.</p>
