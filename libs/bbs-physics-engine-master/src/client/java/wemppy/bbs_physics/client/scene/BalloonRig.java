/**
 * Ties one balloon form to its pressurized soft body. The cloth rig's arrangement throughout —
 * everything shared lives in {@link SoftBodyRig} — with two things of its own.
 *
 * <p>The mesh is <b>closed</b>: a UV sphere of faces wound so their volume comes out positive, which
 * is the orientation Jolt's pressure pushes <em>outwards</em> on (established by the BalloonSmoke
 * stand, where the other winding collapses). And it has <b>pressure</b>: mapped from the 0..1
 * inflation knob as {@code knob² × 3000 × radius² × mass} — radius <em>squared</em> because the
 * solver's stability limit is step distance against cell size, and cells shrink with the ball; the
 * stand blew a quarter-radius ball up on a linear mapping before this one held.</p>
 *
 * <p>No vertex is ever pinned: a ball has no held edge. Only the ball's <em>constitution</em> is
 * baked at creation — its size, its mesh and its pressure, which Jolt has no live setter for — so
 * those edits take effect when the form editor closes; everything an author turns while watching
 * (friction, damping, bounce, the gravity factor that turns a football into a helium balloon) is
 * pushed to the live body.</p>
