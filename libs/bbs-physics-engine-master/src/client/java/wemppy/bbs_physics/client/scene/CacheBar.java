/**
 * The strip along the bottom of the timeline that says how much of the film's physics is worked out
 * (Р8.2), and what the recording is doing about the rest.
 *
 * <p>This exists because the recording contract makes a promise the old one did not — "this frame
 * is the truth, and it will be the truth again next time you come here" — and the price of that
 * promise is that some frames are not ready yet. Without a bar, an author scrubbing ahead of the
 * recording sees a shot with no physics in it and has no way to tell "not computed" from "broken".
 * With one, the same moment reads as a progress bar filling, which needs no explanation at all.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>One colour was not enough</b> (Р16): a grey tail meant four different things — still
 * computing, waiting for the author's hand to leave the slider, out of memory, or a body lost to
 * the solver — and the author had to guess which. So the recorded part is cyan while it is
 * growing and while it is done, the whole strip turns amber while the background is deliberately
 * holding back after an edit, a white head marks where the recording is being extended this very
 * frame, and a red notch marks the tick where something went wrong: the recording running out of
 * room, or a body leaving the world.</p>
 *
 * <p>Its own strip rather than a tint on the film's own track, which was the choice Вемпи made: the
 * track already carries clips and keyframes, and a third layer of colour on it would be one thing
 * too many to read at a glance.</p>
