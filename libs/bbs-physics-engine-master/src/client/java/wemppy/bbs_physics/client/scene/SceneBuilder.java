/**
 * Turning a film's cast into bodies: the one pass that reads what every form asks for and builds it.
 *
 * <p><b>Order is the whole of this class.</b> An actor's collision markup is one collection that
 * several owners take from, and each of them has to take its share before the next one runs:</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>The <b>ragdolls</b> claim their bone slots first, welded bones included. A welded bone has no
 * body of its own, so leaving it behind would put a second collider where its owner's shape already
 * is, standing on the animation while the owner falls away from it.</li>
 * <li>The <b>chain modifiers</b> claim theirs next, for the same reason: a bone that is going to
 * hang must not also become a kinematic body standing on the animation.</li>
 * <li>Everything left over becomes the actor's <b>kinematic bones</b> — the bones the animation
 * kept, which is what a falling part with no falling parent gets jointed to ("the ragdoll is only
 * on the head": the head hangs off the walking torso instead of dropping free).</li>
 * <li>Only then are the <b>ragdolls and strands themselves</b> built, because their joints need
 * those kinematic bodies to already exist.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The form tree is walked three times and no more: once for the ragdoll-enabled models, once for
 * the chain modifiers, once for everything that becomes a rig of its own. Each used to be its own
 * hand-written recursion carrying its own copy of the path and anchor conventions — see
 * {@link FormTreeWalk} for what those conventions are and why a private copy of them is a liability.
