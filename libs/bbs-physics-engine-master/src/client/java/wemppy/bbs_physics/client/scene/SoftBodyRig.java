/**
 * What a sheet of cloth and an inflated ball have in common, which turns out to be almost
 * everything: a soft body whose vertices are the answer, driven towards an animated shape by the
 * authority handle and recorded vertex by vertex.
 *
 * <p><b>The body never moves; its vertices do.</b> It is created at the scene's origin with
 * {@code setUpdatePosition(false)}, so a vertex's local position <em>is</em> its position in scene
 * coordinates — one space fewer to get wrong, and the recording's conversion into the form's frame
 * is a single inverse per tick. Proven semantics, not assumed ones: the ClothSmoke stands
 * established what {@code putVertexLocations} returns, that {@code invMass 0} holds a vertex, that a
 * held vertex is driven by writing its position each tick, and that contact is two-way.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The authority handle means here what it means everywhere (§4).</b> At 1 every vertex is
 * stood on the shape the author placed — the body is kinematic in everything but name. Below 1 the
 * loose vertices are <em>pulled</em> there: each tick they are given the velocity that would carry
 * them home, blended with what they already have in the handle's proportion — the same velocity mix
 * the rigid bodies use, for the same reason: a fade is a fade, never a switch. At 0 the shape is
 * entirely the solver's.</p>
 *
 * <p>What the two do differently is what is left abstract: where a vertex belongs when the animation
 * owns it, how many there are, and whether any of them are held.</p>
