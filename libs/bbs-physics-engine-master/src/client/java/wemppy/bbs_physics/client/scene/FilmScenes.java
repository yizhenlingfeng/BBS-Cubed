 * <p>Scenes are keyed by the controller object rather than by the film's id, because the editor
 * throws its controller away and builds a new one whenever the cast changes — two controllers for
 * the same film are two different scenes, and treating them as one would hand a rebuilt cast the
 * old simulation.</p>
 *
 * <p>Nothing in here is allowed to take BBS down with it. The calls arrive from inside BBS's own
 * tick and render, injected there by a mixin, so an exception would land in the middle of the
 * host's frame. Every entry point therefore catches, reports once and drops the scene: a film
 * without physics is a far better outcome than a film that crashes the game.</p>
