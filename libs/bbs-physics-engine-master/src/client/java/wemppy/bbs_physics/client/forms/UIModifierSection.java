/**
 * A folding section with a cross in its header — Blender's modifier panel, where the thing that
 * removes the modifier lives on the modifier itself.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the header needs help.</b> BBS draws a section's header with a label whose {@code render}
 * is replaced outright: it paints the fold arrow and the title and stops there, without the pass
 * that draws an element's children. A cross added to the header is therefore laid out, resized and
 * clickable — and invisible. That is exactly what happened to the previous one, and it is why this
 * class draws the icon itself, after the section has drawn everything else.</p>
 *
 * <p>Clicking needs nothing: BBS offers a click to an element's children before the element itself,
 * so the cross takes it before the header can fold the section under it.</p>
