/**
 * A modifier that is described bone by bone: the model's skeleton as a list, a tick in the margin
 * for the bones it claims, and whatever knobs belong to the selected one underneath.
 *
 * <p>Both modifiers that work this way — the ragdoll and the chain — used to carry their own copy of
 * all of it: the list, the search box, the tick's hit test, the dot that says a bone has a shape, and
 * the "am I syncing" flag that keeps a value callback from writing back what it was just handed. The
 * two copies had already started to differ in ways nobody chose.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Many bones at a time.</b> The list is multi-select, with the gestures BBS's pose bone list
 * already taught — Shift for a run, Ctrl for one more — and a knob turned here writes into every
 * selected bone, not just the one the panel is showing. A rig is described in groups (all the
 * fingers bend the same way, all the hair hangs the same way), and doing that one bone at a time was
 * the same numbers typed twenty times. The values on screen are the <em>first</em> selected bone's:
 * a panel showing an average of twenty bones would be showing a number none of them has.</p>
 *
 * <p>A tick clicked with several bones selected takes them all in — or leaves them all out, matching
 * the row that was clicked rather than flipping each one, so the click has one visible outcome
 * instead of twenty different ones. A tick clicked <em>outside</em> the selection is about that row
 * alone: the author is pointing at it, not at what happens to be highlighted elsewhere.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Two rules the subclasses inherit rather than rediscover.</b> A value callback may
 * <em>write</em> but must never change the layout: {@code UITrackpad} calls back while it is being
 * dragged, which happens inside the render pass, so rebuilding this element's children from there
 * tears the list the renderer is walking — a crash on the first drag of a slider. And the collision
 * markup is read once per frame here rather than per row: it is stored as one blob on the form, so
 * asking per row meant parsing the whole thing sixty times a second for every visible bone.</p>
