/**
 * Draws a form's collision markup over the form itself, in the form editor.
 *
 * <p>Marking up blind is the difference between a tool and a guessing game: a capsule is placed by
 * moving it until it sits on the limb, and that needs the limb and the capsule on screen at the
 * same time. The film's debug overlay shows the finished result, but by then the editor has been
 * closed.</p>
 *
 * <p>Drawn without depth testing on purpose. Almost every collider is <em>inside</em> the model it
 * belongs to, so an overlay that respected depth would be an overlay that is never visible.</p>
 *
 * <p>The shapes are collected at unit scale and then multiplied by the frame they belong to, which
 * is the opposite of what the simulation does — it bakes the scale into the shape and drops it from
 * the frame, because a Jolt shape does not scale. The two agree exactly for a uniform scale, and
 * for a non-uniform one the preview follows what is <em>drawn</em>, which is the more useful of the
 * two while shapes are being placed by eye.</p>
