/**
 * The scene's own numbers, written over the film editor's viewport.
 *
 * <p>Shown with the debug overlay, alongside the shapes it draws — the shapes say where the
 * simulation thinks things are, and this says whether the simulation is where the film is. Together
 * they are the difference between "physics is being weird" and a named cause.</p>
 *
 * <p>Two kinds of line. The first is always there and states the plain facts, the recording's reach
 * among them. The rest appear only when something is wrong and are written in the colour of a
 * warning, because each of them is a specific, known reason for a specific complaint: a frame the
 * recording has not reached is why the picture is animation rather than physics, a body with
 * nothing marked up is why it fell through the floor, and a body past the collected blocks is why
 * it fell through <em>everything</em>.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is the readout's shape until the cache bar lands under the timeline (Р8.2), which is
 * where "how far is it computed" really belongs — visible without the debug overlay, and legible at
 * a glance instead of as a number.</p>
