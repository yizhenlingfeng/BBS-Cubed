/**
 * Which pixels of a texture are painted — the one thing the pixel mode ({@link
 * wemppy.bbs_physics.collision.CollisionMode#PIXELS}) needs to know about a texture.
 *
 * <p>Read back from the texture BBS has already uploaded, so what collides is exactly what is
 * drawn: a skin composed of several layers, a colour link, an animated texture's current frame —
 * whatever the renderer resolved, this sees the same bytes. Off the render thread, where the GPU
 * cannot be asked, the file is read instead.</p>
 *
 * <p>Cached per link and kept until BBS swaps the texture object — which is what its watchdog
 * does when the file changes on disk — because the read is a full GPU round trip, and the
 * collision preview asks for it every frame.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The threshold is half.</b> A pixel counts as painted at 50% alpha or more. Cubic
 * textures are almost always all-or-nothing and the choice does not matter for them; where an
 * author has softened an edge, it errs towards the smaller silhouette, which is the right way to
 * be wrong: a lock that sinks a pixel into a shoulder is invisible, a lock that stops a pixel
 * short of it is not.</p>
