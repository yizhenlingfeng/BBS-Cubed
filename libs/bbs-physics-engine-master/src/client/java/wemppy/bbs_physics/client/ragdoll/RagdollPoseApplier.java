/**
 * Substitutes the ragdoll's simulated pose into a model at draw time.
 *
 * <p>It writes where every constraint stage writes — {@code ModelGroup.orient} (the bone's full
 * local rotation, applied in place of the channels) and {@code ModelGroup.offset} (a shift in the
 * parent frame) — and it runs in the constraint phase between IK and the chain physics. Which is
 * the whole trick: the channels stay untouched FK truth, IK on ragdolled bones is faded out along
 * with the rest of the animated pose, and the hair chains that run right after anchor themselves to
 * bones that are already fallen. Nothing downstream had to learn anything.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>By the handle's weight, like every other stage of that phase.</b> The simulated frame is
 * mixed into what the pipeline had rather than replacing it, so 0.4 on the handle draws four tenths
 * of the fall — and, which is the point, a full 1 draws none of it and a full 0 draws all of it,
 * with nothing happening on any particular tick in between. The substitution used to be
 * all-or-nothing under a "handle below 1?" test, and that test was a threshold on a continuous
 * handle: harmless letting go, where the bodies are standing on the animation anyway, and a visible
 * jerk taking the character back, where they are only near it.</p>
 *
 * <p>The state holds each simulated bone's <em>pivot frame</em> in the model's flipped group space
 * — the space the render walk composes matrices in, actor-independent. Turning that absolute frame
 * into the local {@code orient}/{@code offset} takes the parent's composed frame, so the walk here
 * mirrors the renderer's own composition step for step, corrected bones included: a corrected
 * parent's children compose on the corrected frame, and bones that are themselves simulated get
 * their own absolute correction on top — errors never accumulate down the chain.</p>
