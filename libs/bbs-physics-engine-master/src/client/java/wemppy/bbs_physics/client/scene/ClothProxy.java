/**
 * The rigid stand-in that lets one sheet of cloth land on another.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists at all.</b> Jolt does not resolve soft bodies against each other — not
 * slowly, not approximately, not at all. Measured rather than assumed: a free sheet dropped onto a
 * pinned hammock with the layer pair switched on passed straight through it and landed on the
 * floor (ClothSmoke round 5). So "make cloth collide with cloth" cannot be a line in the layer
 * table; something rigid has to stand where the cloth is.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What it is.</b> A grid of thin kinematic slabs, one per patch of cells, teleported every
 * tick to the middle of the patch it stands for and turned to face the way that patch faces. Other
 * sheets collide with the slabs and drape over them; the sheet that owns them is excused by a
 * group filter, because a sheet that met its own proxies would be inflated from inside by them —
 * seen happening before the filter was added, and it looked exactly like the cloth ballooning.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What it deliberately does not do.</b> The slabs live in {@link PhysicsLayers#CLOTH_PROXY},
 * which pairs with cloth and nothing else: a proxy must never shove a crate or a bone, or a cape
 * would bat props around with a surface the author never described — those already collide with
 * the sheet itself, properly and softly.</p>
 *
 * <p>Known approximations, both cheap to live with: the slabs follow the sheet by one tick (they
 * are placed from where the vertices ended up last step, which is the only thing known before this
 * one), and a patch is represented by a flat slab, so a sharply creased sheet is met by a
 * coarser surface than it looks. Both get finer as the stride drops, at a body per patch.</p>
