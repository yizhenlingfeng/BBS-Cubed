/**
 * One simulated thing hanging off an actor: a prop, a ragdoll, a sheet of cloth, an inflated ball,
 * a rope, a strand of hair — anything the scene drives on the way in and reads back on the way out.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> The scene used to keep a list per kind and walk all of them side by
 * side in seven places: driving them, recording them, handing frames out, pushing them, releasing
 * them, counting them for the readout, and tying ropes to them. Adding the sixth kind meant finding
 * and editing all seven loops, and forgetting one of them is a silent bug of exactly the sort that
 * is hardest to see — a strand that is never told about an explosion, a sheet whose form is never
 * handed back at shutdown. Now the scene holds one list and each of these loops is one loop.</p>
 *
 * <p>The order in the list is the order things were built in, and that is load bearing: the
 * ragdolls publish where their bones actually ended up, and everything pinned to a bone — a crate
 * in a fallen hand, a cape on a fallen shoulder, hair on a fallen head — is driven after them so it
 * follows this tick's fall rather than the one before it.</p>
