/**
 * The form editor for a form that <em>is</em> its physics — cloth, the balloon, a rope.
 *
 * <p>One class for all of them, because the editor itself never differed: a single tab holding the
 * form's own panel, then BBS's usual ones. What differs is the panel, the tab's name and its icon,
 * which is exactly what a constructor is for.</p>
 *
 * <p>It also gives the shared Physics and Collision tabs something to recognize (see
 * {@code UIFormMixin}): those two tabs describe adding physics to a form that did not have any, and
 * a soft form has no modifier to add and no collision shape to describe. Asking "is this editor a
 * soft form's" beats listing the three classes by name, which is a list that would have to be found
 * and extended every time another one is added.</p>
