/**
 * Walking a form and everything nested inside it, once, in the one order that matters.
 *
 * <p>Every part of the addon that looks for something in an actor — bodies, ragdolls, sheets,
 * strands, collision markup, models that have not loaded — is asking the same question of the same
 * tree, and each of them used to carry its own copy of the recursion. Ten copies of four lines is
 * cheap; ten copies of a <em>convention</em> is not, and there are two of those here that everything
 * else depends on being got right:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>The path.</b> A form is addressed by its position in the tree — "0/2" is the third body
 * part of the first — and that string is the key its evaluated matrix is read back by. The index
 * advances for <em>every</em> slot, including the empty ones, because BBS's own matrix walk does;
 * a walk that skipped empties would name every form after an empty slot wrongly and quietly drive
 * the wrong thing.</li>
 * <li><b>The anchor.</b> Descending out of a model means everything below hangs on one of its
 * bones, and that bone is what a ragdoll moves. So a child of a model takes that bone as its
 * anchor, and anything deeper inherits it: a sheet two groups down under an arm still hangs on the
 * arm.</li>
 * </ul>
