/**
 * An inflated ball: a textured sphere that Jolt's soft body solver keeps pumped up with pressure —
 * a beach ball that dents when it lands and springs back, a football to knock around, a helium
 * balloon that floats away when the gravity knob goes below zero.
 *
 * <p>The cloth form's sibling in every structural way (Р12: soft bodies are forms of their own,
 * not modifiers): the mesh is a grid the simulation owns, its size is physical, and the shape it
 * takes is the whole point. What sets it apart is that the mesh is closed and has air inside —
 * Jolt's pressure model pushes every face outwards, which is what makes it a ball rather than a
 * sack: poke it and it pops back out.</p>
 *
 * <p>The ball is centred on the form's origin — where the author puts the form is where the ball
 * is, no hanging edge to reason about. The one animation handle every physics form shares (§4)
 * covers it too: at 1 the ball is the perfect sphere the author placed, riding its keyframes; at 0
 * it is entirely the solver's; in between it is pulled towards the sphere by that much. Dropping
 * the handle to 0 mid-flight is the same "let go" every body has — the ball keeps the velocity the
 * animation gave it.</p>
