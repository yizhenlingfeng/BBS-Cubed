/**
 * A form's collision markup: what shape it is, as the form itself describes it.
 *
 * <p>This is a description, not a body. Nothing here decides what is simulated — that is up to
 * whoever reads it, and the readers want different things from the same markup (§5.2): an actor
 * shoving props wants one kinematic body per marked bone, a model falling as one piece wants them
 * all welded into a single shape, a ragdoll wants a few large ones with joints between, and hair
 * will one day want no bodies at all, just something to bump into. Keeping the markup free of that
 * decision is the whole reason it lives on the form instead of inside the physics body form.</p>
 *
 * @param slots keyed by bone name for a model, or by {@link #SELF} for the form's own shape
