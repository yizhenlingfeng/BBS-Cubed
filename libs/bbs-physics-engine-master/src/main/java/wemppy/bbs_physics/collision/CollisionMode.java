 * cost contacts on hundreds of cubes, and worse, it would fight the hair and cloth solvers for
 * ownership of the bones they drive (§5.2).</p>

     * The bone's cubes as their <em>drawn</em> surface: every side of every cube becomes thin
     * plates laid over the pixels that are actually painted, and nothing is built where the
     * texture is transparent — or inside the cube at all.
     *
     * <p>For the way cubic models are really made. A strand of hair is not a solid box: it is a
     * flat cube, often of no depth whatsoever, with a lock painted on it and the rest of the
     * texture left clear; the second layer of a head is a whole cube with hair painted on three
     * of its sides. Measured by its bounds, such a cube collides as a slab of air and hits the
     * body a pixel or more before the hair does. Read by its pixels, the collision is the
     * silhouette the viewer sees.</p>
     *
     * <p>This replaces the older "face" mode — one plate on one side the author named — which is
     * exactly what this produces for a cube whose side is painted edge to edge, without the
     * author having to name the side. Files saved with that mode load as this one.</p>
     *
     * <p>Live, like {@link #AUTO}: nothing is written down but the choice, so a cube that changes
     * size, or a texture that is repainted, takes its collision with it.</p>
