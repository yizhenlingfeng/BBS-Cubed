/**
 * Moving a kinematic body to where the animation has it this tick — the counterpart of
 * {@link BodyDrive} for the bodies physics never owns: an actor's bones, a ragdoll at a full
 * handle, a rope's pins.
 *
 * <p><b>Steered when the target is a motion, placed when it is a cut.</b> {@code moveKinematic}
 * hands Jolt the velocity that arrives at the target in one tick, and that velocity is the whole
 * point: it is what a shoulder shoves a crate with. But keyframes do not only describe motion — a
 * film cuts, an actor is keyed from one side of the set to the other in a single frame — and a
 * "velocity" across a cut is the distance divided by a twentieth of a second. The body sweeps the
 * whole way ({@code LinearCast} sweeps precisely so that nothing is skipped), batting everything on
 * the path aside at hundreds of blocks per second, and whatever it was jointed to inherits the
 * swing. One keyed teleport read as an explosion.</p>
 *
 * <p>So a target no honest animation reaches in one tick — farther than {@value #MAX_STEP} blocks,
 * or turned more than half-way round — is treated as what it is: a cut. The body is put there and
 * stopped, exactly as a scene reset puts it, and nothing between the two places ever feels it.
 * Below the threshold nothing changes at all, which is what makes this safe to use everywhere:
 * the fastest swing a film plausibly animates is well under it.</p>
