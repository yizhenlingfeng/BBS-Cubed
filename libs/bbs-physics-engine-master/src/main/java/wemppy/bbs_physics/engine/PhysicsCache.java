/**
 * The film's physics as a <em>recording</em>: what every simulated thing was doing on every tick,
 * worked out once going forwards and read back thereafter.
 *
 * <p>This is the contract the addon took from Blender (§2.5, §6 of the concept), and it is the
 * reason half of this project's difficulty went away. Physics is a sequence — tick 300 is a
 * consequence of the 299 ticks before it — and the previous design tried to make a sequence
 * randomly addressable: snapshots every ten ticks, a rewind that restored the nearest one, a
 * re-simulation of the remainder inside a step budget, and an entire class of bugs about the world
 * standing on a different tick than the film. A recording has none of that. Scrubbing reads an
 * array; there is no "arrived by a different route", because there is only one route.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What a channel is.</b> Everything that has an answer per tick registers one: a physics body
 * form, one bone of a ragdoll, one debug body — or a whole sheet of cloth. A channel has a width of
 * its own, claimed when it is registered: a rigid transform is {@value #FLOATS} floats (position,
 * rotation, and one number that is not geometry — the authority handle as it stood on the simulated
 * tick, cached rather than read from the form because the form's keyframed values are written at
 * draw time on a fractional tick), while a soft body's channel is three floats per vertex. Whatever
 * the width, the <em>last</em> float of a channel is its marker: the authority for a transform,
 * and {@link #SILENT} for a tick the channel had nothing to say on.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What is not cached is the reason this is cheap.</b> The frames a body's answer is expressed
 * in — actor-local for a body, the model's group space for a ragdoll bone, the form's own frame for
 * cloth — depend only on the tick, so the conversion is done once during recording and the numbers
 * stored are the ones the renderer substitutes directly. Playing back a recorded film therefore
 * evaluates no poses at all.</p>
 *
 * <p>A transform channel costs thirty-two bytes a tick; a thousand-tick film with thirty of them is
 * under a megabyte, which is why the whole thing can simply be kept. Cloth is the reason the ceiling
 * exists: a hundred-vertex sheet is twelve hundred bytes a tick all by itself.</p>
