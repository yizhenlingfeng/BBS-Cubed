/**
 * The speed a body is let go with, read off the <em>swing</em> rather than off the last twentieth
 * of a second before the hand opened.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the last tick is the wrong tick.</b> A body the animation owns is steered by
 * {@link KinematicDrive}, which hands Jolt the velocity that arrives at this tick's pose — and Jolt
 * keeps that velocity when the body turns dynamic, which is what makes a throw a throw. It works
 * perfectly for an animation that is still travelling when the handle drops. But an author keys a
 * throw the way an author keys everything: a pose here, a pose there, smooth interpolation between
 * them. Smooth interpolation <em>arrives at rest</em> — the velocity at a keyframe is zero by
 * construction — so a hand that swung across the set at four blocks a second is, on the very frame
 * the object leaves it, doing almost nothing. The object inherited that almost-nothing and dropped
 * where it stood, and no amount of work on the release itself could have fixed it: the speed was
 * gone before the release was reached.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>So the release reads a window.</b> The last few ticks of animated pose are kept, and the
 * body is let go with the fastest single tick among them — the swing at its strongest, which is
 * what "he threw it" means and what an author is picturing. Games that let a player throw something
 * held in the hand do exactly this and for exactly this reason: the last frame before a release is
 * almost always a deceleration.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What it will not do is invent a throw.</b> The window is the animation's own motion, so an
 * object the keyframes carried somewhere and set down is let go with nothing, because nothing is
 * what its keyframes were doing. A throw with no swing behind it is what the impulse clip is for
 * (§5.5). And the newest tick in the window is the velocity the body would have inherited anyway,
 * so taking the fastest can only ever help a release, never slow one down.</p>
 *
 * <p>Held per rig and pushed once a tick while the animation owns the body; a cut in the keyframes,
 * a reset, or the animation taking the body back throws the window away, because a jump across the
 * set is not a swing and must never be read as one.</p>
