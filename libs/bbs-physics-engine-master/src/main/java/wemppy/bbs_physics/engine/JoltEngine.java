 * types. All of it is global state inside Jolt itself, so it is set up once and never torn down —
 * the game keeps running until it exits, and there is nothing to gain by giving it back earlier.
 *
 * <p>Physics worlds are built on top of this per model; this class only answers whether there is
 * anything to build them on.</p>
 *
 * <p>Failure is a normal outcome here, not a crash: an exotic platform, a disk that can't be
 * written to, a security policy that forbids loading libraries. In all of those the addon reports
 * it once and marks itself unavailable, and BBS goes on animating without physics — a missing
 * feature is a far better outcome than a game that won't start.</p>
