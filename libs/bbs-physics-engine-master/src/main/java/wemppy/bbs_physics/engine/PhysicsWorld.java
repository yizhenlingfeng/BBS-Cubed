/**
 * One Jolt world. Everything physical in a scene lives in a single one of these and is stepped
 * together — that is the whole point of bringing an engine in: a body can only push another body
 * if they share a world.
 *
 * <p><b>Units are blocks.</b> Jolt is tuned for metres and stops behaving well below roughly ten
 * centimetres, so a block is fed to it as a metre. Model pixels (a sixteenth of a block) would put
 * small bodies right at the engine's resolution limit, where they jitter and sink through floors.
 * BBS's own bone physics already works this way — it divides its lengths by 16 everywhere.</p>
 *
 * <p>The world owns native memory, so it must be {@link #close() closed}. It also keeps its layer
 * tables in fields for the same reason: Jolt holds them by raw pointer, and letting the Java
 * objects be collected while the system is still running would pull the ground out from under it.</p>

     * sinking into each other, and the difference between a contact that resolves smoothly and one
     * that arrives as a bang.
     *
     * <p>Three, to land on 60 Hz. BBS's own chain solver has always run three sub-steps per tick
     * and says why in its own comment: the in-between shapes are then actually simulated rather
     * than guessed from coarse 20 Hz snapshots. Simulating at 40 Hz where the thing an author is
     * comparing against runs at 60 is a step backwards they can see.</p>
     *
     * <p>Fixed rather than adaptive on purpose: the number of steps is part of the simulation's
     * arithmetic, and a value that drifted with the frame rate would make a film stop being
     * reproducible.</p>
