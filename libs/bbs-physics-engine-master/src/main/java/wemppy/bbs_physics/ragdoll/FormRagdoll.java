/**
 * A model form's ragdoll setup: whether it ragdolls at all, which of the marked bones take part,
 * and how each of them is jointed.
 *
 * <p><b>Shape and participation are two questions.</b> The collision markup says what shape a bone
 * is; it does not say the bone should fall. Those were the same answer until an author asked for
 * the case that proves they are not: a character whose body and head both collide, but only the
 * head comes off. So the markup still decides what a bone <em>is</em>, and {@link #excluded} decides
 * whether the ragdoll claims it.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>An unclaimed bone is one of two things</b>, and the scene tells them apart by itself, from
 * the bone tree — there is no third setting to get wrong. With no falling bone above it, it stays a
 * kinematic body riding the animation and shoving what it hits: the torso that walks on. Underneath
 * a falling bone, it is welded into that bone's body — headwear on a head — because "I do not fall
 * and my parent does" can only mean nailed to it. Ticking a bone back into the ragdoll is therefore
 * also how an author says "this one <em>does</em> swing free", pompom on a welded hat included.</p>
 *
 * <p>Exclusions rather than a list of members, so the default needs no writing down and a bone
 * marked up later is a ragdoll part without anyone revisiting this. A bone absent from
 * {@link #joints} likewise uses {@link RagdollJoint#DEFAULT} — the soft cone — so an enabled ragdoll
 * with nothing else configured already works, and both collections only record what was changed.</p>
 *
 * <p>The whole-ragdoll knobs live here beside the per-bone joints, and they are what an author
 * turns first: how heavy the body is, how much its limbs resist, whether it fights to hold its
 * pose ({@link #muscles}) or hangs like a puppet with the strings cut.</p>
 *
 * @param mass         the whole ragdoll's weight in kilograms, shared out among its parts by their
 *                     volume; 0 leaves each part weighed by Jolt at water's density
 * @param damping      the share of its spin a part sheds per film tick — 0 windmills, 1 stops dead
 * @param friction     resistance in every joint, in newton-metres. 0 is a wind chime
 * @param gravity      how much of the scene's gravity the parts feel
 * @param selfCollide  whether parts that do not share a joint collide with each other; off is
 *                     cheaper and fine for a body that only ever lies down
 * @param muscles      how hard every joint pulls towards the animated pose while the ragdoll is
 *                     free: 0 is a corpse, 1 a body that all but stands up again. Stunned,
 *                     drunk, staggering — the middle of the range is where those live
 * @param muscleDamping how much the muscles overshoot: 0 springs back and forth, 1 settles once
