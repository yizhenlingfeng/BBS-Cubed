/**
 * A sheet of cloth: a textured rectangle that Jolt's soft body solver bends, swings and drapes
 * over whatever it lands on — a cape, a flag, a curtain, a towel over a chair.
 *
 * <p>A form of its own rather than a modifier on the picture form (Вемпи's call, Р12). It draws
 * like a picture — one texture on a rectangle — but nothing else about it is picture-like: the
 * rectangle is a grid the simulation owns, its size is physical rather than pixel-derived, and
 * the whole point of the thing is the shape it takes on its own. What it has instead of the
 * picture's knobs is where it is held ({@link ClothEdge}) and what its fabric is like.</p>
 *
 * <p>The sheet hangs <em>down</em> from the form's origin: the held edge runs along the pivot, so
 * dropping the form onto a body part at the shoulders hangs a cape, and onto a pole hangs a flag.
 * The one animation handle every physics form shares (§4) covers cloth too: at 1 the sheet is the
 * flat rectangle the author placed, at 0 it is entirely the simulation's, and in between the loose
 * vertices are pulled towards flat by that much.</p>
