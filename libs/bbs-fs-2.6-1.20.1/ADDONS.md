# Writing an addon for BBS

BBS has an addon API: a package of contracts an addon can build against, and a set of events BBS
posts while it registers its own things, which is where an addon registers its own.

## What is and isn't a contract

Everything in `mchorse.bbs_mod.api` and its sub-packages is a contract. Nothing else is.

The rest of BBS moves without notice — a class gets renamed, a field goes private, a method grows
a parameter — and an addon that reached into it breaks **silently, in the game rather than on the
build**. That is not a threat, it is just what a mixin into another mod's internals costs.

The whole public surface of the API is dumped into [`api/bbs-api.txt`](api/bbs-api.txt), which
lives in this repository. Any change to it shows up in the diff of the commit that made it, and
`gradlew apiCheck` (which `build` depends on) fails when the two drift apart. `BBSApi.VERSION` is
bumped whenever a change in there is one an addon cannot survive.

## Getting in

An addon implements `mchorse.bbs_mod.api.BBSAddonMod` — an empty marker — and declares it in its
`fabric.mod.json`:

```json
"entrypoints": {
    "bbs-addon": ["com.example.MyAddon"],
    "bbs-client-addon": ["com.example.client.MyAddonClient"]
}
```

`bbs-addon` is read on both sides, at the very top of BBS's initialization. `bbs-client-addon` is
read on the client only: the client-side events live in BBS's client source set, and a class that
so much as mentions one of them cannot be loaded on a dedicated server. Keep the two apart.

Methods annotated with `@Subscribe` and taking exactly one argument are then called with the
events of that argument's type:

```java
public class MyAddon implements BBSAddonMod
{
    @Subscribe
    public void onSettings(RegisterSettingsEvent event)
    {
        BBSApi.requireVersion("myaddon", 1);
        /* ... */
    }
}
```

Subscribers are collected from the whole class hierarchy, an override replaces the method it
overrides, and an override that drops `@Subscribe` unsubscribes it. A subscriber that throws is
logged and the rest keep running — a broken addon stays distinguishable from an absent one.

Subscribing to a base event type receives every event derived from it: `BaseRegisterSettingsEvent`
is called for both the common and the client settings events.

## Versioning

Declare the BBS version your addon needs in `fabric.mod.json`, so the loader refuses a mismatch
before any code runs:

```json
"depends": { "bbs": ">=2.6" }
```

and call `BBSApi.requireVersion("myaddon", <api version>)` from your entry point for the case
where it got in anyway. Without it, a mismatch reads as "the game crashes on the first right
click" rather than "this addon does not fit this BBS build".

## Building against BBS

There is no public Maven repository. Publish BBS into your local one:

```
gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

and depend on it:

```groovy
repositories {
	mavenLocal()
}

dependencies {
	modImplementation("mchorse:bbs:${bbs_version}") { transitive = false }
}
```

`transitive = false` keeps BBS's own Sodium/Iris/glsl-transformer out of your build. Note the
consequence: your dev client then runs BBS without Sodium and Iris, and BBS's mixins into them are
skipped with a warning, so nothing that depends on shaders is exercised there.

Keep `yarn_mappings` and `loader_version` in lockstep with the BBS build you compile against — a
mismatch breaks the dev environment in ways that look like anything but a mapping mismatch.

**The Loom remap cache trap.** Loom caches the remapped mod by its Maven coordinates, and BBS's
version does not change while it is being worked on. So a rebuilt BBS is silently ignored, and it
looks exactly like your changes to BBS not existing. See `docs/addon-template/build.gradle` for a
build script that notices and clears the cache by itself.

## The registration events, in order

BBS fills a registry, then posts the event for it. Subscribe to the event, register into what it
hands you, and your things sit next to BBS's own.

Both sides, from `BBSMod`:

| Event | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| `RegisterSourcePacksEvent` | your own assets, addressable as `yourmod:...` |
| `RegisterKeyframeFactoriesEvent` | your own keyframe value types |
| `RegisterFormsEvent` | your own forms |
| `RegisterCameraClipsEvent` | your own camera and overlay clips |
| `RegisterActionClipsEvent` | your own action clips |
| `RegisterSettingsEvent` | your own settings file and categories |
| `BBSReadyEvent` | everything is registered; look, don't register |

The client only, from `BBSModClient`:

| Event | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| `RegisterL10nEvent` | your own language files, before the first load |
| `RegisterModelLoadersEvent` | your own model format |
| `RegisterFormSectionsEvent` | your own tab in the form palette |
| `RegisterKeybindsEvent` | your own key combos, as a class of them |
| `RegisterClientSettingsEvent` | your own client settings |
| `RegisterFormRenderersEvent` | how your forms draw |
| `RegisterFormEditorsEvent` | how your forms are edited |
| `RegisterClipPanelsEvent` | how your clips are edited |
| `RegisterKeyframeEditorsEvent` | how your keyframe values are edited |
| `RegisterValueWidgetsEvent` | how your settings value types are drawn |
| `RegisterClipRenderersEvent` | how your clips draw their strip on a timeline |
| `RegisterTrackStylesEvent` | the colour and icon of your track properties |
| `RegisterImportersEvent` | what happens to a file of your type dragged into the assets |
| `RegisterDashboardPanelsEvent` | your own dashboard panel (posted when the dashboard is first opened) |
| `BBSClientReadyEvent` | the client half is registered |

No registry fills itself in a static initialiser any more, so "before" and "after" mean something:
whatever you register in one of these events is in place before BBS uses it, and BBS's own entries
are in place before you are called.

## Types named in the API

The API package holds the events and the entry points. The types they hand you — `Form`, `Clip`,
`FormArchitect`, the factory interfaces — live where they always did, and are covered by the same
promise by being named in a signature that `api/bbs-api.txt` records. Reaching for a type the API
never mentions is reaching into BBS's internals.

## Extending one of BBS's forms

A renderer and an editor panel are looked up by the form's own class first, then by the classes it
extends. So a form extending, say, `BillboardForm` draws and edits like one until you register
something of your own for it — and you register only the part you actually changed.

## Naming things

Give every id you register a namespace: `yourmod:gadget`, not `gadget`. Two reasons. It keeps you
out of BBS's way and out of other addons'. And it is what makes your data survive your addon being
switched off: BBS keeps unknown namespaced keys, unknown forms, unknown clips and unknown tracks
verbatim and writes them back out unchanged, so a user who removes your addon for an evening still
has their scene when they put it back. An un-namespaced key of yours is indistinguishable from one
of BBS's own that was removed, and is dropped on save.

## Adding to forms you did not write

`RegisterFormModifiersEvent` runs a step of yours on every form BBS makes:

```java
event.register((form) -> form.add(new ValueFloat("myaddon:wobble", 0F)));
```

Everything else follows from the value existing. It is saved and read like any other; the timeline
finds a track for it, because the track catalogue walks a form's values rather than a list of
names; its keyframes work, because the value carries its own factory. Give the track a colour with
`RegisterTrackStylesEvent` if you care how it looks.

The palette's forms are templates and are built directly, so they are not modified. Everything
that lands in a scene is copied, and a copy is read through the factory — so what a user actually
animates always has your value.

## The life of a film

`FilmEvents` has the four moments a scene has: `CREATED`, `TICK_BEFORE`, `TICK_AFTER`,
`RENDER_AFTER`, `SHUTDOWN`. `FormRenderEvents.BEFORE` and `.AFTER` wrap the drawing of one form —
every form, anywhere BBS draws one.

These are plain Fabric events, not the addon bus: two of them run every tick and every frame, and
the bus finds its subscribers by reflection. Register your listeners once, from `BBSReadyEvent` or
`BBSClientReadyEvent`.

Whatever you build in `CREATED`, let go in `SHUTDOWN`. A listener that skips it leaks for the rest
of the session. Every controller comes through — the film playing in the world, the editor's
preview, the recorder — so ask the controller which it is when that matters.

`BBSModClient.getFilms().getControllers()` lists the films playing right now.

## Vanilla fields BBS widened

BBS widens access to a handful of vanilla fields (the ones the item-model predicates read, and the
game's framebuffer). An access widener applies only to the mod that declares it, so yours would
need a second copy of BBS's — and two copies drift. Call
`mchorse.bbs_mod.api.compat.VanillaAccess` and `…api.client.compat.ClientVanillaAccess` instead;
a method needs no widener.

## A worked example

[`docs/addon-template`](docs/addon-template) is a complete, buildable addon: entry points on both
sides, a version check, its own assets source, a form built on top of one of BBS's, a value added
to every form, a settings category, a track style and film listeners. Its `build.gradle` also
carries the Loom cache workaround described above.

Build it with BBS's own wrapper:

```
gradlew publishToMavenLocal          # in the BBS repository
gradlew -p docs/addon-template build
```

## What is still a mixin

Honest list of what the API does not cover yet, so nobody hunts for a method that isn't there:

- **Audio.** A clip that plays sound extends `AudioClip`; there is no interface for it, because
  the audio path — the renderer, the export, the waveform on the timeline — is written against
  that class. This is what `VideoClip` does.
- **Track kinds.** The kinds of track a film can animate are an enum. An addon's own kind of track
  (as opposed to its own animated property, which the modifier above covers) has no way in yet.
- **Adding a tab to someone else's editor panel.** A form's panels are registered on the form's
  own editor; there is no hook to add one to a form you did not write.
